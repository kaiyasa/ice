= Investigating computing evolution

People including myself take computers for granted and
fail to realize how a computer actually works and the usefulness
symetry of that knowledge to every day life and problem solving. 

= Why "Computer"?

Before the time of the availibility of these remarkable tools we
call computers today, a computer was a person whose primary task
was to solve mathematical equatations.  Naturally mathematians
performed this task but for large projects and such, it was
a person who knew produces for doing mathematics and handling
data to produce conclusions or results.

This was expensive, time consuming, and error prone.  Thus as
society grew and its complexity increased, the need for 
computing skills grew and the need for automating these
tasks.
