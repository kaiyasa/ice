= Recipes

Being computation of equations was the one of main
driving forces behind the effort to automate, most
of the early machines resolved around representing
numbers and basic mathematical operations such as ADD
and SUBTRACT.

However there is an overlooked aspect of mathematics
where choice or decision points occur in the procedures
of performing calculations.

== Ingredants?

So we know that decision, arithamatic operation
are needed to automate computation.  But how do we
represent numbers?

As humans we would naturally prefer our decimal system
as it took a couple of centuries to establish and proven
quite adept at computation.  However, it is quite difficult
to invent and produce physical devices that can have 10 basic
states.

Analog ciruits, graduated values and scales

== Boole and DeMorgan

== Putting boolean and circuits together
